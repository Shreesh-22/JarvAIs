    question: "Why JarvAI instead of regular voice control?",
    answer:
      "It blends voice + gestures + context, so you act in the momentâ€”not after digging through menus. JarvAI understands what you're doing and surfaces help exactly when you need it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work across all apps?",
    answer:
      "JarvAI runs at the OS level and includes app-specific skills for popular tools. Generic commands work anywhere on screen, so you're covered whether you're in Chrome, Notion, or your terminal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it always listening?",
    answer:
      "No. It wakes on a local keyword or a keyboard/gesture cue. You have complete control over when the microphone is active, and all processing happens on-device when possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we use it at work?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Team plans include workspace policies, custom macros, shared skill packs, SSO, and admin controls to help everyone ride in formation while maintaining security.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about Windows and Linux?",
    answer:
      "Mac is available now. Windows is in waitlist (join above), and Linux support is on our roadmap. We're building for all platforms where people do their best work.",
